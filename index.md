# Welcome!

This is a list you nerds can use to add links for common dupes to. More to this is coming soon. Here's the list:

## Dupe List

| ID       | Short description, keywords
|--------- |----------------------------
| 10349820 | Subchannels, Sub Chat
| 11115879 | Screensharing           
| 10521852 | Video Chat, Video Calling
| 10325589 | Spoiler Tags
|   TODO   | Add more

## Contributing

If you want to contribute a dupe, you can either [Make a PR directly](https://github.com/LW001/DFB-Dupes/pulls) or [Create an issue](https://github.com/LW001/DFB-Dupes/issues) to let others implement it. The same goes if you want a link removed (Because you don't think it's relevant or it was deleted/merged).

## Other stuff

Please note this repository was made by LW001 (LW001#8654) and not by Discord Staff. Do not bother them about this.
